# Space-Shooter
Welcome to my Space Shooter project! This game is developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and leverages the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics rendering and game mechanics.
# How to Setup
To set up the SFML library in Visual Studio and run this Space Shooter project, first, download and install SFML from the official website. Next, create a new project in Visual Studio, and configure the project properties to link SFML libraries and include directories. Finally, add the provided source files to your project, build, and run to start playing the game.
